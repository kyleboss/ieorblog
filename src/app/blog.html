                        <p>
                            In five years, I see myself as someone who has worked with Tech to improve the quality of life
                            for humanity as a <i>whole</i>: rich or poor, black or white, queer or straight. I see myself
                            continuing the fight to provide the tools necessary to <strike>navigate around</strike> destroy
                            The Great Firewall of China so that the Chinese citizens are empowered with uncensored
                            information. I don't wish to be known, famous, or rich. I wish to live simply, knowing that I
                            have used my skill-set to create a tool that has empowered humanity. I see myself accomplishing
                            this goal probably with people who have similar beliefs yet different skills. It probably does
                            not involve me working for a Fortune 500 company or with a large disposable income; however,
                            <i>in five years, I will hopefully be able to take solace in knowing that I helped make a
                                difference.</i>

                        <h2 class="para-title">Strengths</h2>
                        <i>Good with technology</i>: I have an active passion for technology and its social
                        implications. Currently a computer science major & a full-stack developer for a company in the
                        bay. I aspire to use these skills to help build tools that empower all of humanity.
                        <br /><br />
                        <i>Leads positively</i>: Prefer to give compliments to those who do a good job than to
                        criticize. One catches more bees with honey than vinegar! This is how creativity
                        thrives.
                        <br /><br />
                        <i>Doesn't procrastinate</i>: Prefer to start early & get the ball rolling. Able to detect
                        barriers early so there is no need to stay up late as deadlines approach. Often yields more
                        quality work.
                        <br /><br />
                        <i>Enjoy public speaking</i>: By no means am I a professional, but public speaking is an
                        activity that I thoroughly enjoy and love improving. Great for all aspects in life such as
                        conversations, projects, hackathons, etc.
                        <br /><br />
                        <i>Detail oriented</i>: Modularize tasks to their basic components. I enjoy crossing things off
                        of lists. This allows me to have a great sense of what it means to be "complete" when
                        programming.

                        <h2 class="para-title">Deltas</h2>
                        <i>Communication</i>: I sometimes find it difficult to communicate technical ideas to technical
                        folk. Often times it is because I taught myself a lot of the technical skills I know so I am
                        not completely equipped with the technical vocabulary yet.
                        <br /><br />
                        <i>Trouble giving orders</i>: I have a tough time giving orders when I lead. I fear of judgement
                        and so sometimes my attempts at giving orders come off as passive aggression or just blunt. This
                        gets me into trouble whenever I would like something done urgently.
                        <br /><br />
                        <i>Taking criticism</i>: I can take criticism too personally. I sometimes question motives &
                        sources of authority when a flaw is pointed out. Only recently have I been attempting to see
                        criticisms as ways to improve & <i>not</i> flaws.
                        <br /><br />
                        <i>Bite off more than I can chew</i>: I tend to take on more tasks than I can accomplish before
                        a given deadline. I feel it is because during planning meetings I desire to be the "hero." As I
                        begin to accomplish said tasks I quickly realize I under-estimated the time it would take.
                        <br /><br />
                        <i>Trouble seeing the "big picture"</i>: At times I modularize tasks so much that I have
                        difficulty seeing the big picture of projects. I notice this especially when working on teams &
                        it comes time to combine all of my tasks with the rest of the members' tasks.
